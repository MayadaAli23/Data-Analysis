# 📈 Data Analysis Projects Portfolio

This repository contains my data analysis projects using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Each project explores a real-world dataset and applies exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and insightful visualizations.

These projects reflect my skills in working with structured data, finding patterns, and presenting clear insights.
